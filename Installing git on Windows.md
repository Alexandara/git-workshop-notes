I don't work on a windows machine often so please forgive me for any confusion. 

I've found the easiest way to install and work with git on windows is to use `git bash`. [Install it from this website](https://git-scm.com/). 

Follow the installation wizard to the end. Then open your menu, find the git bash application and open it. If you can't find it press the windows key and start typing git bash. 

Now all of our commands will be the same moving forward.
