A `repo`, short for repository, is git speak for a version controlled directory of files. Every directory we initialize is a repo.

When collaborating with others you'll often be told to clone a repo (or fork and clone). Let's review that process by cloning the repo for these notes. Yup! I'm using git to version control these notes and make them accessible to everyone in the workshop.

I'm using an application called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) to write these notes. It works in any operating system. I'll show you how to clone this repo and open them in Obsidian so you can follow along.
