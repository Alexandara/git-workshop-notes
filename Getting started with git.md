git can be a scary and confusing technology. It doesn't have to be! The basic workflow is simple:

- create a git repository
- write code
- add and commit code
- push to a remote repository

These are unfamiliar concepts right now. By the end of the course I hope you'll see the benefits of git and remote version control systems (GitHub, but there are others).

## Installing git
This might be the most difficult part of getting started with git. Every system is a little different. If you are using a mac it likely came with your system. If you are using windows you'll need to install it.

- macOS: [[Installing git macOs]]
- Windows: [[Installing git on Windows]]
- Linux: I trust you know what you are doing!
