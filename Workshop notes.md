## Workshop Notes
The notes for this workshop are written and presented using a program called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). These notes are written in Markdown and are available on GitHub. You will have access to them throughout this workshop. Think of these notes as a living version of the workshop. As I find additional resources or content I'll add them to the notes and push the changes to GitHub.

We'll talk about [[cloning a repo]] later (specifically cloning these notes). But if you can't wait the URL for this repo is `https://github.com/kissmygritts/git-workshop-notes.git`. To get a copy of these notes do the following steps:

1. Navigate to the repo on GitHub
2. `git clone` with the URL of the repo
3. Download Obsidian
4. When you open Obsidian choose open an existing vault and select the folder you just cloned.

Again, we will download together in the [[cloning a repo]] section.
