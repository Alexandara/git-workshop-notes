A big reason to use git is to better work with collaborators. This is an additional git workflow that is a variation on the basic workflow outlined in [[Getting started with git]].

1. Find a repo you want to contribute to on GitHub
2. Fork the repo to your GitHub account
3. Clone you fork of the repo to your computer
4. make changes:
	1. `git add` those changes
	2. `git commit` those changes
	3. `git push` those changes to GitHub
5. Create a pull request to the original repo
